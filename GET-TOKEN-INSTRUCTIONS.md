# ðŸ”‘ How to Get Your JWT Token for Business Simulation

## ðŸ“‹ **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

### **1. Open Your Browser Developer Tools**
- Open your InvoiceGen Pro app in the browser (`http://localhost:3000`)
- Make sure you're logged in
- Press `F12` or right-click and select "Inspect Element"

### **2. Navigate to Application/Storage Tab**
- In the developer tools, click on the **"Application"** tab (Chrome/Edge)
- Or click on the **"Storage"** tab (Firefox)

### **3. Find Local Storage**
- In the left sidebar, expand **"Local Storage"**
- Click on **"http://localhost:3000"**

### **4. Copy Your Token**
- Look for a key named **"token"**
- Click on it to select the value
- Copy the entire token value (it's a long string starting with "eyJ...")

### **5. Update the Simulation Script**
- Open the file: `invoicegen-pro/backend/simulate-business-data.js`
- Find the line: `const YOUR_TOKEN = 'YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE';`
- Replace `'YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE'` with your actual token (keep the quotes)
- Save the file

### **6. Run the Business Simulation**
```bash
cd invoicegen-pro/backend
node simulate-business-data.js
```

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting:**

### **If you get "Authentication failed":**
- Make sure you're logged into the app
- Get a fresh token from browser localStorage
- Ensure the token is copied completely

### **If you get "Client already exists":**
- This is normal if you've run the script before
- The script will skip existing clients and continue

### **If you get network errors:**
- Make sure your backend is running on port 5001
- Check that your frontend is running on port 3000

---

## ðŸ“± **Quick Token Copy Method:**

**In Browser Console (F12 â†’ Console tab):**
```javascript
console.log(localStorage.getItem('token'));
```
This will print your token in the console for easy copying.

**ðŸŽ‰ Once you run this simulation, your app will be populated with realistic business data that demonstrates all the features professionally!**
