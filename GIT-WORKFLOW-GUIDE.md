# 🔄 Git Workflow Guide for InvoiceGen Pro

## 📋 **Branch Structure**

Your repository now has a professional 3-branch structure:

### **🌟 main** (Default Branch)
- **Purpose**: Stable, tested code ready for showcase
- **Protection**: Should be protected from direct pushes
- **Merges from**: `production` branch only
- **Used for**: Portfolio demonstrations, stable releases

### **🚀 production** 
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code for deployment
- **Protection**: Should require pull request reviews
- **Merges from**: `development` branch only
- **Used for**: Live deployments, production releases

### **🔧 development**
- **Purpose**: Active development and feature integration
- **Protection**: Can accept direct pushes for development
- **Merges from**: Feature branches and direct commits
- **Used for**: Daily development, testing new features

---

## 🔄 **Recommended Workflow**

### **For Daily Development:**

1. **Switch to development branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   ```bash
   # Edit files, add features, fix bugs
   git add .
   git commit -m "✨ Add new feature: client health scoring"
   ```

3. **Push to development**
   ```bash
   git push origin development
   ```

### **For Production Releases:**

1. **Merge development to production**
   ```bash
   git checkout production
   git pull origin production
   git merge development
   git push origin production
   ```

2. **Deploy from production branch**
   - Use production branch for Railway/Render/Heroku deployments
   - Use production branch for Vercel/Netlify deployments

### **For Stable Releases:**

1. **Merge production to main**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git merge production
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Tag the release**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "🎉 Release v1.0.0: Complete InvoiceGen Pro"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

## 🛡️ **Branch Protection Rules**

### **Recommended GitHub Settings:**

#### **main branch:**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ✅ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB

#### **production branch:**
- ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ✅ Allow force pushes (for emergency fixes)

#### **development branch:**
- ✅ Allow direct pushes (for rapid development)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging (if CI/CD is set up)

## 📝 **Commit Message Conventions**

Use conventional commits for better project management:

### **Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### **Types:**
- `✨ feat:` - New features
- `🐛 fix:` - Bug fixes
- `📚 docs:` - Documentation changes
- `💄 style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `♻️ refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `⚡ perf:` - Performance improvements
- `✅ test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `🔧 chore:` - Maintenance tasks
- `🚀 deploy:` - Deployment-related changes

### **Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "✨ feat(client): add client health scoring algorithm"
git commit -m "🐛 fix(invoice): resolve tax calculation rounding issue"
git commit -m "📚 docs: update API documentation for client endpoints"
git commit -m "🚀 deploy: configure production environment variables"
```

## 🔄 **Feature Development Workflow**

### **Option 1: Direct Development Branch**
```bash
# Switch to development
git checkout development
git pull origin development

# Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "✨ feat: add invoice PDF export functionality"
git push origin development
```

### **Option 2: Feature Branches (Recommended for larger features)**
```bash
# Create feature branch from development
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/pdf-export

# Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "✨ feat: add PDF export with custom branding"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/pdf-export

# Create pull request on GitHub: feature/pdf-export → development
```

---

## 🚀 **Deployment Workflow**

### **Development Deployment:**
```bash
# Deploy development branch for testing
git checkout development
git pull origin development
# Deploy to staging environment
```

### **Production Deployment:**
```bash
# Merge development to production
git checkout production
git pull origin production
git merge development
git push origin production

# Deploy production branch
# Use production branch for live deployment
```

### **Hotfix Workflow:**
```bash
# Create hotfix from production
git checkout production
git pull origin production
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# Fix the issue
git add .
git commit -m "🐛 hotfix: resolve critical payment processing bug"

# Merge back to production and development
git checkout production
git merge hotfix/critical-bug-fix
git push origin production

git checkout development
git merge hotfix/critical-bug-fix
git push origin development

# Delete hotfix branch
git branch -d hotfix/critical-bug-fix
```
