## 🔄 **MIGRATION CHANGES**

### **1. Routing System**
- **Before:** React Router (`react-router-dom`)
- **After:** Next.js App Router (file-based routing)
- **Changes:**

  - Replaced `useNavigate()` with `useRouter()` from `next/navigation`
  - Created page components in `src/app/` directory structure

### **2. Project Structure**
- **Before:** Single-page application with client-side routing
- **After:** Multi-page application with server-side rendering capabilities
- **Benefits:** Better SEO, faster initial page loads, improved performance

### **3. Component Migration**
- ✅ All UI components migrated successfully
- ✅ All page components migrated successfully
- ✅ All services and utilities migrated successfully
- ✅ Authentication system migrated successfully

### **4. Dependencies**
- ✅ Removed `react-router-dom` (not needed in Next.js)
