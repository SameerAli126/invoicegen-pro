# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Configuration

## ✅ **CORRECT BRANCH TO DEPLOY: `production`**

You've correctly selected the **production** branch for deployment. This is the recommended approach for the following reasons:

### **Why Production Branch?**
- ✅ **Stable Code**: Contains tested, production-ready code
- ✅ **Deployment Ready**: Optimized for live environments
- ✅ **Professional Workflow**: Follows industry best practices
- ✅ **Quality Control**: Only merged code from development branch

---

## ⚙️ **Netlify Configuration Settings**

### **Build Settings**
```
Repository: https://github.com/SameerAli126/invoicegen-pro.git
Branch to deploy: production
Base directory: frontend
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: frontend/build
```

### **Environment Variables**
Add these in Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
NODE_VERSION=18
```

### **Build Command Details**
```bash
# Netlify will run these commands:
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
# Deploys the 'build' folder
```

---

## 🔧 **Required Configuration Files**

### **1. Create `netlify.toml` in root directory**
```toml
[build]
  base = "frontend"
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[context.production]
  command = "npm run build"

[context.deploy-preview]
  command = "npm run build"
```

### **2. Update `frontend/package.json`**
Ensure these scripts exist:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "18.x"
  }
}
```

## 🌐 **Backend Deployment (Railway)**

### **Step 1: Deploy Backend First**
1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Select the **production** branch
4. Set root directory to `backend`
5. Add environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app
   ```

### **Step 2: Get Backend URL**
After Railway deployment, you'll get a URL like:
`https://your-app-name.railway.app`

### **Step 3: Update Netlify Environment**
Add the backend URL to Netlify:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app/api
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **1. Build Fails**
```bash
# Check Node.js version
NODE_VERSION=18

# Verify package.json scripts
"build": "react-scripts build"

# Check for missing dependencies
npm install
```

#### **2. API Calls Fail**
```bash
# Verify environment variable
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/api

# Check CORS configuration in backend
const corsOptions = {
  origin: ['https://your-netlify-app.netlify.app'],
  credentials: true
};
```

#### **3. Routing Issues**
```toml
# Add to netlify.toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

#### **4. Environment Variables Not Loading**
- Ensure variables start with `REACT_APP_`
- Restart build after adding variables
- Check variable names for typos
